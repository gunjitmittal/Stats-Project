# Stats-Project

## Pre-Processing 
For now i have loaded the data, removed the unnecessary fields, encoded the data with single options. Tried for multi option but couldn't reach an optimal solution. Better to use in condition to check for a particular label wherever needed.Feel free to suggest other things and if feasible will add it.


## Data-Visualisation 
#### [- Donal Loitam](https://github.com/Donal-08)
In this project, we utilized various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. We created a range of plots using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:

- Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables
- Histograms, BarChart, Piechart, density plots to examine the distribution of data
- Box plots to compare distributions across groups

These visualizations were key to our analysis, as they allowed us to quickly identify trends and patterns in the data, and helped us to identify any outliers or anomalies that required further investigation. Npt to mention, they helped in supporting some results of hypothesis testing as well.
