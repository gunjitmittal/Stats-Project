## Data Collection
#### [- Gunjit Mittal](https://github.com/gunjitmittal)
Collected data by creating an interactive form on cognito form and floating it to friends. Applied restrictions on the form itself in order to ensure the quality of the data.

## Pre-Processing 
#### [- Gunjit Mittal](https://github.com/gunjitmittal)
Collected data was further cleaned to remove malicious entries. After that the data was processed to make it easier to work with. The language of choice for the same was python and pandas was the main library involved which is useful for processing data in various applications.


## Data-Visualisation 
#### [- Donal Loitam](https://github.com/Donal-08)
In this project, we utilized various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. We created a range of plots using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:

- Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables
- Histograms, BarChart, Piechart, density plots to examine the distribution of data
- Box plots to compare distributions across groups

These visualizations were key to our analysis, as they allowed us to quickly identify trends and patterns in the data, and helped us to identify any outliers or anomalies that required further investigation. Not to mention, they helped in supporting some results of hypothesis testing as well.
